[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mmckinst/puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mmckinst/puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check)

A puppet-lint plugin to check you are not using top scope fact variables like
`$::operatingsystem`. You should use the $facts hash like
`$facts['operatingsystem']` instead.

## Installing

### From the command line

```shell
$ gem install puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check
```

### In a Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check', :require => false
```

## Checks

#### What you have done

```puppet
$service_name = $::operatingsystem {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
$service_name = $facts['operatingsystem'] {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-top_scope_facts` to your puppet-lint
command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-top_scope_facts path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should
insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_top_scope_facts')
```

## Limitations

* It only finds facts using the top-scope: ie it will find `$::operatingsystem`
  but not `$operatingsystem`
* If you have legit, non-fact top scope variables, it will incorrectly find
  them.
